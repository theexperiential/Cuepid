:mega: This is a work in progress.

Cuepid easily controls disguise media servers using OSC, and transmits OSC/DMX (Art-Net) messages to disguise and/or any media server (or lighting system) that supports these protocols. It can transmit many messages, both simultaneously and repeatedly in set intervals, to up to 3 separate OSC devices and 1 DMX device in the same show.

:performing_arts: This tool is perfect for media server operators and/or VJs who want a quick and easy way to control their shows, no matter how complex. It makes for a great boilerplate as well, for more advanced users looking to develop their control systems beyond the core functionality.
