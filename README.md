# Cuepid
## A simple TouchDesigner control and trigger app built for disguise and friends.

This is a work in progress.

Receives OSC playback info from disguise, and transmits OSC/DMX (Art-Net) messages to disguise and/or any media server or lighting system that supports these protocols. Can transmit many (complex) messages at once, and repeatedly in set intervals. Keyboard shortcuts are also a thing. 

(Will be) Useful in show production environments where a clear and functional UI is necessary for the triggering of many systems at once. (Note that it's still in alpha so bugs may and probably do still exist.)

Many features planned, including a timeline of sorts... Feel free to leave feedback/bug reports in the Issues section, or drop us a line at hello@tec.design

Cheers!
