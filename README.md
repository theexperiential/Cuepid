:mega: This is a work in progress.

Cuepid easily controls disguise media servers using OSC, and transmits OSC/DMX (Art-Net) messages to disguise and/or any media server or lighting system that supports these protocols. Can transmit many (complex) messages at once, and repeatedly in set intervals, to up to 3 separate OSC devices and 1 DMX device at the same time. 

This tool is perfect for media server operators and/or VJs who want a quick and easy way to control their shows, no matter how complex.
