# Cuepid
## A simple control and trigger app for disguise.

This is a work in progress. 

Receives OSC playback info from disguise, and transmits OSC/DMX (Art-Net) messages to disguise and/or any media server or lighting system that supports these protocols. Can transmit many (complex) messages at once, and repeatedly in set intervals. Keyboard shortcuts are also a thing.

Many features planned, including a timeline of sorts... Feel free to leave feedback/bug reports in the Issues section, or drop us a line at hello@tec.design

Cheers!
